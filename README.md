# About

(WIP) This [StereoKit](https://stereokit.net) project implements the XR_FB_spatial_entity OpenXR extensions for the StereoKit library. This enables us to track/persist world-locked anchors on Meta Quest devices! This project is built with the [sk-multi](https://github.com/StereoKit/StereoKit.Templates) template to support cross-platform app development on either Android or Quest+Link platforms.

This project implements the following OpenXR extensions:
- XR_FB_spatial_entity
- XR_FB_spatial_entity_storage
- XR_FB_spatial_entity_query

# Features to-do
